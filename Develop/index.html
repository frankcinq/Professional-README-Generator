<!-- MINI PROJECT:
- create index.js
- run npm init
- run npm install inquirer
- const fs = require('fs');
- const inquirer = require('inquirer');
- Store individual inputs from the user somehow (variable)
    - Get these from the inquirer's "response" object

    - Just use inquirer's .prompt() method
- prompt user
- creat prompts
    - maybe use array of strings to store prompts
    - Prompts:
        - What is your name?
        - Where are you from?
        - What is your favorite hobby?
        - What is your favorite food?
        - Enter your Github Username:
        - Enter your Linkedin URL:
    - What do we pass into the .prompt() method
        - Uses an array of objects that look like:
            {
                **type: ...( probably just "input" for the most part)
                **message: ...(this is the actual prompt displayed to the user)
                **name: ... (can be anything I want... is used as property name on the response object
                to retrieve the value that the user typed)
            }
    - Uses Promise .then(callbackFunction...);
            inquirer.prompt ([{...}, {...}, {...}]).then(response => {...});
                - Maybe console.log successfully
                - Create the HTML and incorporate user responses (from response object)
                    - probably using Template Literal syntax to build the HTML
                - Write/ouput HTML file to the application root director (same as folder that contains the .js)
                    - use the fs.writeFile(fileName, htmlString, (err) => {...}) method
                            -Need to write out Success message after successfully outputting HTML
                                - inside writeFile callback, verify that there was no error.
                                -Just use console.log() for this
- create questions
- verify user inputs (maybe stretch goal)
        - may need to use a while loop before moving on to next question
- Create the HTML and incorporate user responses (from variables)
        - probably using Template Literal syntax to build the HTML
- Need to write out Success message AFTER html page created
- Write/output HTML file to the application root director (same folder that contains the .js)
- TASK: Someone needs to design what the HTML should look like.
    - Design as an actual HTML file in VS Code for speed, then can copy into a Template Literal in code and modify
    to include variable values.
- Learn to use Inquirer Node package/API
- Learn to use filesystem (FS) API build in to Node
    -use the fs.writeFile() method
